Function Definition:
validateEmail(): This function is responsible for validating the email format on the client side before the form is submitted.
Fetching Email Value:
g_form.getValue('email'): Retrieves the value from the email field on the form. Replace 'email' with the actual name of your email field.
Email Validation:
The same regular expression is used to validate the email format.
The if condition checks whether the email is present and whether it fails the validation.
Error Handling:
If the email format is invalid, g_form.showFieldMsg() displays an error message next to the email field, guiding the user to correct it.
Returning false prevents the form from being submitted until a valid email is provided.
Form Submission Handling:
g_form.setSubmitHandler(validateEmail): Sets the validateEmail function to be called when the form is submitted, ensuring validation occurs before any data is saved.
