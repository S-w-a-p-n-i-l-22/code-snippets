To close incidents that are older than 30 days in ServiceNow, we can use a scheduled job or a background script. 
Below is a sample script that runs in the scheduled job.
This script will close all incidents older than 30 days and will require mandatory fields such as close notes and resolution notes.

1) Date Calculation:
The script calculates the cutoff date by subtracting 30 days from the current date.
2) GlideRecord Query:
A GlideRecord object is created for the incident table.
The script queries incidents created on or before the cutoff date and excludes any that are already closed (state != 7).
3) Loop Through Results:
For each incident that matches the query, the script:
Sets the close_notes and resolution_notes fields.
Updates the state field to 7 (Closed).
Calls incidentGR.update() to save the changes.
4) Logging:
Logs a message in the system logs for each incident that is closed, which can be useful for auditing purposes.
