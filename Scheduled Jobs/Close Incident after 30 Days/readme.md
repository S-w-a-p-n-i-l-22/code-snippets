GlideRecord: This code creates a new GlideRecord for the incident table.
Querying: It looks for incidents that are not in the 'Closed' state (state value 7) and that were created more than 30 days ago.
Updating Records: For each matching record, it sets the state to 'Closed' and adds a note before updating the record.
